         <h3>Why he's a good person</h3>
         <p1>I think that my Dad is a good person for a few reasons. The first reason is that he is always fair, he always tries to
          see from both sides of a story and make a fair judgment around it. The second reason is how he is always kind and caring to
          my siblings and I. The third and final reason is that he always supports our hobbies as much as he can, for example, I skateboard,
          my Dad used to skateboard and he helps me learn new tricks and is understanding when I break a skateboard or shoes because he knows
          that skating is a expensive sport where things break a lot. This also links back to my second and first reason, he sees my side of
          the story when I damage my skating gear and tries to help in any way he can, one example is him paying me forward so I can keep skating
          and I can do jobs later to work for the new things.
